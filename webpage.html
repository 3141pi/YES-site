    <h2>Spectrometry Lab Results - Introduction:</h2>
    <p>A spectrometer is a device which measures light on the electromagnetic spectrum. Many of these devices can measure all sorts of different properties from the light it measures. These properties can include intensity, variation, and polarization. The spectrometer was invented in the 1860s by Gustav Kirchoff and Robert Bunsun, but it is still useful to us today. In astronomy, scientists use spectrometry to identify the chemical composition of stars and planets, as well as help them understand the origins of the universe. Today, we tested spectrometers against white paper and blue colored paper. We measured the standard values of light (measured in voltage) from a well-known source. This was the white paper, which is known to reflect all light. We also measured the dark voltage, which is the amount of voltage the spectrometer displays when there is no light on the sensor. We tested the percentage of reflectance the blue colored paper had for each color. This was modeled by the equation: % Reflectance = (Sample Voltage - Dark Voltage) / (Standard voltage - Dark Voltage) x 100.   </p>

    <h2>Spectrometry Lab Results - Our Data:</h2>
    <p>Our data was conclusive. Out of all kinds of light, the blue light had the highest reflectance from the blue colored paper. Something that was surprising was the fact that the spectrometer also picked up significant amounts of other kinds of light. Deep-Red light was measured with a reflectance percentage almost as high as the blue light was. Green and yellow light had the least of all, at only around 10-11% reflectance. Also be sure to note the four infrared sensors. They mostly recieved reflectance percentages much higher than the other colors. They have a lower frequency than regular light. The relationship between percent reflectivity and frequency is definitely something worth further investigation.     </p>
